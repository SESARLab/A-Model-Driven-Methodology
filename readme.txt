The Big Data revolution promises to build a data-driven ecosystem where better decisions are supported by enhanced
analytics and data management. However, major hurdles still need to be overcome in the road that leads to commodization and wide
adoption of Big Data Analytics (BDA). Big Data complexity is the first factor hampering the full potential of BDA. The opacity and variety
of Big Data technologies and computations in fact make BDA a failure prone and resource-intensive process, which requires a
trial-and-error approach. This problem is even exacerbated by the fact that current solutions to Big Data application development take a
bottom-up approach, where the last technology release drives application development. Selection of the best Big Data platform, as well
as of the best pipeline to execute analytics, represents then a deal breaker. In this paper, we propose a return to roots by proposing a
Model Driven Engineering (MDE) methodology that supports automation of BDA based on model specification. Our approach lets
customers declare requisites to be achieved by an abstract Big Data platform and smarter engines deploy the Big Data pipeline
carrying out the analytics on a specific instance of such platform. Driven by customers’ requisites, our methodology is based on an
OWL-S ontology of Big Data services and on a compiler transforming OWL-S service compositions in workflows that can be directly
executed on the selected platform. The proposal is experimentally evaluated in a real-world scenario focusing on threat detection
system of SAP.
