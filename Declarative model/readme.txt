Declarative model

configuration.json presents the declarative model used in the experimental evaluation. It mainly defines three requirements: 
i) log dataset must address data minimization privacy requirement by hashing field UserID using SHA-256, while guaranteeing full analytics quality; 
ii) data must be analyzed by using the clustering algorithm k-means with km in [1,. . .,10];
iii) data visualization must provide scatter-plots, supporting visual inspection of data by expert users, to select valid alerts.

A web application allowing the user to specify declarative requirements can be accessed at http://alphaplus.di.unimi.it/mytoreador
