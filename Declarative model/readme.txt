The declarative model used in experimental session

It mainly defines three requirements: 
i) log dataset must address data minimization privacy requirement by k-anonymizing the UserID field with ka=5, while guaranteeing full analytics quality; 
ii) data must be analyzed using the clustering algorithm k-means with kmâˆˆ[1,. . .,10];
iii) data visualization must provide scatter-plots, supporting visual inspection of data by expert users, to select valid alerts.

A web application allowing the user to specify declarative requirements can be accessed at http://alphaplus.di.unimi.it/mytoreador
