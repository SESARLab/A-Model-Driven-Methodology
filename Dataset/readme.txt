Dataset used in the experimental session

 We used a log data set containing around 6 weeks of activity collected from SAP systems deployed in a test environment. We considered three features, namely Executed Transaction, Data Sent, and Data Received, extracted from the log files and aggregated
per user. For testing purpose, we artificially generated a data set with multi-variate Gaussian distribution having the same average and covariance matrix as the original data points.
